 * \brief  XMEGA DAC driver example source.
 *
 *      This file contains an example application that demonstrates the DAC
 *      driver. It shows how to set up the DAC in dual-channel mode with
 *      correct sample and refresh timing. The example outputs two triangle
 *      waves, phase shifted 180 degrees.
 *
 *      The sample and refresh timing settings are based on a CPU frequency
 *      of 2 MHz. Please refer to the module datasheet for more details on
 *      sample and refresh timing limits.
 *
 *      As this is a DAC example only, we do not use any Timer/counter to
 *      produce a specific waveform frequency. The code outputs the triangle
 *      wave with the highest frequency possible with this unoptimized C code.
